# Starter

Just started playing with Hibernate's envers.  Only initial checkin is completed. Nothing to show for now...

Generic Steps:

  1. git clone https://github.com/samuraichan/projects && git checkout feature-starter-jpa
  2. cd projects/starterJpa
  3. mvn spring-boot:run or just do a mvn test (to run tests using Spring JPA)
  4. http://localhost:8080/starter/
